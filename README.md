EDA explores data patterns, cleans errors and show insights using numbers and charts

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of looking at data to understand what it’s about. It helps you find patterns, spot mistakes, and figure out the best way to use the data for further analysis, like building models or making predictions. Think of it as a first step to "get to know" your data before doing anything advanced.

### Why Do EDA?
1. Understand the data:  
   - What types of data do you have (numbers, text, dates) 
   - Are there missing values or errors?

2. Find patterns:  
   - Are two variables related?  
   - What does the data say about the trends or averages

3. Spot unusual data (outliers):  
   - Are there strange numbers that don’t fit with the rest  

4. Check assumptions:  
   - Does the data follow any known patterns (like being normally distributed) 

#### Steps in EDA*
1. Collect and Load the Data  
   - Example: Load a file into your code using Python.

2. Clean the Data 
   - Fix or remove missing values and errors.  
   - Make sure data types are correct (like dates being treated as dates).

3. Analyze One Variable (Univariate Analysis) 
   - Example: Look at the average age of people in a dataset.

4. Analyze Two Variables (Bivariate Analysis) 
   - Example: Check if height and weight are related by using a scatter plot.

5. Use Visuals  
   - Draw charts like histograms, box plots, or bar charts to see patterns clearly.

##### Tools for EDA in Python  
- Pandas: Helps you view and organize the data.  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Draw charts.  
- Plotly: Create interactive plots you can zoom in on.
